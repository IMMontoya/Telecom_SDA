# Telecom Plan Revenue Statistical Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the revenue generated by two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate, offered by the telecom operator Megaline. Through a preliminary analysis based on a dataset of 500 clients, this study seeks to understand client behavior and determine which prepaid plan is more lucrative for the company. This analysis is intended to support the commercial department in making informed decisions regarding the adjustment of the advertising budget.

Two hypotheses will be tested in this study:

1. The average revenue from users of Ultimate and Surf calling plans differ.  
2. The average revenue from users in NY-NJ area is different from that of the users from other regions.

## Data Preparation

- **Type Conversion**: Converted dates from strings to datetime objects and numerical values to appropriate numeric types to facilitate analysis.
- **Error Handling**: Applied Megaline's billing practices by rounding up the duration of each call to the nearest minute, as even calls lasting just a second are billed as one minute. This adjustment ensures that revenue calculations accurately reflect the company's charging scheme.
- **Monthly Usage Calculations**: For each user, calculated the total number of calls, minutes used, text messages sent, and data consumed per month. Additionally, rounded up the total data usage per month to the nearest gigabyte in accordance with Megaline's billing practices.
- **Revenue Calculation**: Derived the monthly revenue from each user by subtracting the free package limit from the total usage, applying the plan's overage rates, and adding the base monthly charge. This involved careful consideration of each plan's allowances and rates for minutes, messages, and data beyond the included amounts.

## Data Analysis

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Computed mean, variance, and standard deviation for call minutes, texts, and internet data usage for users of each plan. These metrics provided insights into the typical behavior of customers on each plan.
- **Visualization**: Generated histograms and box plots to visualize the distribution of monthly usage and revenue for each plan. This helped identify differences in usage patterns and revenue generation between the two plans. Visualizations are stored in the [images folder](./images)
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Analyzed the data to understand how customer behavior varies between the two plans. This included examining the extent to which users exceed their plan allowances and the impact on revenue.

## Hypothesis Testing

- **Revenue Comparison between Plans**: Tested the hypothesis that the average monthly revenue from users of the Ultimate and Surf plans differs. Formulated null and alternative hypotheses, choosing an appropriate significance level (alpha) for the tests.

    > **Conclusion:** Upon conducting the statistical tests, we found significant differences in the average monthly revenue generated by users of the Surf and Ultimate plans. The analysis revealed that users on the Ultimate plan, on average, contribute more to the monthly revenue than those on the Surf plan. This result is statistically significant, suggesting that differences observed in the revenue from users of the two plans are not due to random chance but are likely inherent to the plans' structures and pricing.

- **Geographical Revenue Analysis**: Investigated whether the average revenue from users in the NY-NJ area is different from that of users in other regions. This involved similar hypothesis formulation and testing procedures.

    > **Conclusion:** The statistical analysis of geographical revenue data indicated no significant difference in the average monthly revenue from users in the NY-NJ area compared to users from other regions (tested with an alpha value of up to .2). This suggests that geographical location does not significantly influence the revenue generated by users, pointing to the effectiveness of Megaline's pricing strategy across different regions.

- **Testing Approach**: Used the t-test to compare means, carefully selecting independent or paired tests based on the data structure and hypothesis being tested. The choice of tests was justified by the data distribution and sample sizes.
- **Interpretation**: Results were interpreted in the context of the company's strategic decision-making, with a focus on how these insights could influence advertising and product development strategies.

These detailed steps underscore the thorough and methodical approach taken in analyzing the telecom plans, offering actionable insights to inform strategic decisions.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides valuable insights into the performance of Megaline's prepaid plans, aiding in strategic decision-making for marketing and product development.

**Key Finding:s**

- A concise summary of the analysis, highlighting which plan generates more revenue and insights into customer behavior.
- Results of hypothesis tests and their implications for the company's strategy.
